In your appeal, include the date you were banned on, why you were banned *(you should know this)* and why you would like to be unbanned. If you feel that you were unfairly banned for a misunderstanding or a bot accidentally malfunctioned, contact a staff member with an alternate account or get a friend to.\n\n***(Appealing does not guarantee that you will be unbanned.)***"
